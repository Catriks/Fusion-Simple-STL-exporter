# Fusion-Simple-STL-exporter
### Description
Very simple STL exporter for 3D printing projects.

When activated, this script

- exports only currently visible bodies
- saves them to the users Desktop as STL
- file name is the currently active **component** name
- removes version number from the filename
- A pop-up will confirm the path and filename of the saved STL.

Removing the version number allows you to simply reload the part in your slicer. Eg. in Orca slicer, right click the part and choose "Reload from disk".
